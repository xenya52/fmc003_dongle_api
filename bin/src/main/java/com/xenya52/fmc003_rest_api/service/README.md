# Service
The service layer is responsible for implementing the business logic of the application. It acts as an intermediary between the controller and the repository layers, and is used to perform operations on the domain model objects. The service layer is responsible for implementing the business rules and logic of the application, and is used to coordinate the interactions between the controller and the repository layers. The service layer is typically implemented using a service class or interface, and is used to encapsulate the business logic of the application. The service layer is an important part of the application architecture as it provides a separation between the controller and the repository layers, allowing for easier maintenance and testing of the application.

## What's buisness logic ?

The business logic of an application refers to the core functionality and rules that define how data is created, stored, and manipulated to meet the specific requirements of the application. In the context of your web scraping application, the business logic encompasses the processes and rules for:

1. **Scraping Data from Websites**: This involves fetching web pages, parsing HTML content, and extracting relevant information.
2. **Storing Scraped Data**: Saving the extracted data into a database (in this case, MongoDB).
3. **Providing Access to Scraped Data**: Exposing endpoints through a REST API to allow clients to retrieve the stored data.

### Detailed Breakdown of Business Logic

1. **Scraping Data from Websites**

   - **Fetching Web Pages**: Using a library like Jsoup to send HTTP requests and retrieve the HTML content of web pages.
   - **Parsing HTML Content**: Analyzing the HTML structure to locate and extract specific elements (e.g., titles, headings, paragraphs).
   - **Handling Errors**: Managing potential issues such as network errors, invalid URLs, or changes in the HTML structure of the target website.

2. **Storing Scraped Data**

   - **Data Modeling**: Defining the structure of the data to be stored in the database. This includes creating entities and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).
   - **Database Operations**: Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage the data in MongoDB.
   - **Data Validation**: Ensuring that the data being stored meets certain criteria (e.g., non-empty titles).

3. **Providing Access to Scraped Data**

   - **REST API Endpoints**: Defining endpoints to allow clients to interact with the application. This includes endpoints for scraping new data and retrieving stored data.
   - **Versioning**: Managing different versions of the API to ensure backward compatibility.
   - **Error Handling**: Providing meaningful error messages and status codes to clients in case of failures.
