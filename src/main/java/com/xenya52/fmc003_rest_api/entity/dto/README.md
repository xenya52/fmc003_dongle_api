# DTOs
Are Data Transfer Objects. They are used to transfer data between the client and the server. They are also used to transfer data between different layers of the application. They are used to encapsulate the data that needs to be transferred. The difference between a modle and a dto is that a model is used to represent the data in the database, while a dto is used to represent the data that needs to be transferred between the client and the server.
