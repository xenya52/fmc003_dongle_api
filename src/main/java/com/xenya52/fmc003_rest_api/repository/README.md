# Repository
The repository layer is responsible for managing the data access logic and mapping the data to the domain model. It is the lowest level of abstraction and is used to interact with the database. The repository layer is responsible for querying the database, inserting, updating, and deleting records. It is also responsible for mapping the database records to the domain model objects. The repository layer is typically implemented using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework such as Hibernate or JPA (Java Persistence API). The repository layer is an important part of the application architecture as it provides a separation between the domain model and the database, allowing for easier maintenance and testing of the application.
